# Introduction

(Just some notes, make in proper format)
Lately I have been reading "Calssical Mechanics: The theoretical minimum" ...

Since I mostly deal with purely data-driven approaches, I wanted to dive a bit into the
first-principle derivation of predictive models.... I lately have been fascinated by the idea that logic extends knowledge. 
The idea that once the axioms are set, logica can allow us to drive conclusions about nature that are not obvious from those first principles.
I am puzzled by the fact that the logical derivation corresponds to some physical phenomena.

I have seen this in economics, but not as a function of time... profit maximization, consumer curves and so on...

Here I will be looking into the simplest pendulum, a mass whose motion is **restricted to a unit circle**. This simple example will
allow me to reflect in some more interesting topics such as, linearization, neural networks and physics-informed neural networks.

We will use the principle of conservation of energy to derive some differential equation in which we can study the motion of the pendulum.

## Derivation of the potential energy from first principles

Potential energy is just the ammount of work that is _potentially_ stored. In this case it is clear that when the red ball is at the top 
of the circle (0,1) the potential energy is maximum. This is because we are assuming that the only forcing acting here is gravity, so the 
higher up, the more potential energy. Then we can be sure that the total potential energy is proportional to the y coordinate. 

$$V(\theta) = mg(1-\cos(\theta))$$

For $$\theta$$  being the angle between the black and red line. This is 0.79 radians in the above image. On (0, 1) the potential energy is at is 
maximum since $$\cos(\pi) = -1$$. $$mg$$ is the constant to which the potential energy is proportional. Intuitively, this should be how much is the pull
of the force down (gravity, in earth $$9.8 m/s^2$$) and the mass of the ball, (assumed to be 1). 

So far I have only used the fact that the higher the more potential energy.

## Derivation of the kinetic energy from first principles

Assuming that the acceleration is constant, kinetic energy is defined as $$ T(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$. This comes 
from the sum of the work applied over distance, distance being $$d = \frac{1}{2}vt$$ (assuming speed 0 at time 0) and work per 
unit of time being the increase of momentum, $$F = ma = m\frac{v}{t}$$ because $$a$$ is constant, so $$W = Fd = mad = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$.

Surely, the velocity can be expressed as the change in the angle per unit of time so $$v = \dot{\theta}$$. Then the kinetic energy is
$$T(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}m\dot{\theta}^2$$. Going down is indeed negative velocity (the angle is getting smaller in time).

## Derivation of the equation of motion 
Now, since the total energy is constant, we could use that to try to get the equation of motion. However, using the 
principle of stationary action is cooler. This is defined as the integral of all possible paths of the difference between kinetic and potential energy.

$$S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} (T(\dot{\theta}) - V(\theta)) dt = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\theta, \dot{\theta}) dt$$

And we want stationary trajectories, such that the first derivative of S w.r.t the trajectory is 0. This yields[^1] 

$$\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0$$

[^1]: See the first reference for the proof.

So, let's plug in and see what pops out.

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}(T(\dot{\theta}) - V(\theta)) = \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}(- V(\theta))
= -mg\sin(\theta)$$

Because $$T$$ does not depend on $$\theta$$. Now, the other term:

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \dot{\theta}}(T(\dot{\theta}) - V(\theta)) = \frac{\partial}{\partial \dot{\theta}}(\frac{1}{2}m\dot{\theta}^2) =  m\dot{\theta}$$

Now taking the derivative w.r.t time of the previous equation we get:

$$\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = m\ddot{\theta}$$

Plugging this in the Euler-Lagrange equation we get:

$$m\ddot{\theta} = - mg\sin(\theta)$$

Rewriting this equation we get:

$$\ddot{\theta} = - g\sin(\theta)$$

This cannot be solved analytically (TODO: There is really no point to try to solve it because it is way beyond my calculus skills right now tbh.), but it is possible to "solve" it numerically.

### Numerical solution, simulation.

The first thing to do is to reframe this second order differential equation into a system of 2 first order differential equations.
This is, a $$\dot{z_1} = \dot{\theta}$$ and $$\dot{z_2} = \ddot{\theta}$$. Now, for an initial condition of position (angle) and velocity:

$$
\mathbf{f}(z_1, z_2) = (z_2, - g\sin(z_1))
$$

Indeed being $$\mathbf{z}$$ a vector of derivatives. With that, a simple numerical ODE solver such as Euler's method should do. We use
the default settings in the 'solve_ivp' from Scipy. Then for a given initial condition (in this case $$0.85 \pi$$ initial position and $$0$$ initial velocity.) we can visualize the solution:

</p>

It looks a bit weird, and that is because it does not have any friction, it conserves the initial energy forever. We can visualize the evolution of
the angle in time and we will see that it is indeed a perfect sinusoidal wave. With friction we expect a dumped oscillator.

## Adding friction
We can add friction just on the equation of motion:

$$
$$\ddot{\theta} = - g\sin(\theta) - c \dot{\theta}$$
$$
Where the friction is proportional to the speed.
